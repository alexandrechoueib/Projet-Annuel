1. DESCRIPTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------

  The EZLIB project aims at providing useful functions to help in
  application development. The library is composed of a version
  number which is the year and month it was created. The latest
  version is 2018.06. For each version you will find in the 'src'
  directory subdirectories that compose the library as follows:
  
  - 'essential' concerns type definition and useful functions on
     text and convertion to numbers; all other subdirectories rely
     on 'essential'
     
  - 'arguments' is the handling of command line arguments in order 
    to automatize their parsing and the possibility to automatically
    generate the command line synopsis
    
  - 'logging' is a logging system that can help send output 
    information to standard output or to a file
    
  - 'extensions' represents extensions to the STL to extend algorithms
    so that we work on whole containers instead of having to specify
    the begin() and end() iterators
    
  - 'objects' is the redefinition of containers but with more explicit
    methods like 'put_first', 'put_last', 'put_at' and also the fact
    that the first element of a container has index 1, instead of 0
    in C/C++
    
  - 'io' there is not much here for the moment except the CSVFile 
    class to handle Comma Separated Value files
  
  - 'maths' is the possibility to handle series of values, compute
    their average, standard deviation or export data as JSON file
